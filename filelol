(1)     In this powerful narrative, Stevenson receives a call from Charlie's grandmother, who pleads for help as her fourteen-year-old grandson sits in jail. Despite his heavy workload and the knowledge that Charlie is not facing the death penalty, Stevenson feels compelled to assist after hearing about Charlie's dire situation. Moved by the grandmother's prayer for guidance, Stevenson takes on the case.
(2)     Charlie's tragic story raises questions about the goals and values of the criminal justice system. While the system aims to punish wrongdoers and protect the innocent, it fails in the case of George and Charlie. As a young boy, Charlie was unable to physically stop the abuse inflicted upon his mother by her boyfriend, George. He may not have known how to report the abuse or feared retaliation if he spoke up. Feeling helpless and afraid for his mother's safety, Charlie took matters into his own hands, resulting in the fatal shooting of George.
(3)     Delving deeper into Charlie's situation, we discover that George was a respected police officer, and the prosecutor successfully convinced the judge to treat Charlie as a dangerous adult, sending him to an adult jail. When Stevenson, a lawyer, visits Charlie in jail, he sees a small and frightened boy. After several attempts to engage Charlie in conversation, Stevenson finally breaks through, and Charlie reveals that he has been sexually assaulted by other inmates. Stevenson offers comfort and promises to return.
(4)     Stevenson highlights the disparity in treatment between George, a police officer, and Charlie when it comes to domestic violence. Instead of focusing on George's abusive behavior, which left Charlie's mother injured, the blame is solely placed on Charlie. This unjust treatment leads to Charlie being sent to a facility where he faces the risk of harm from other adults. Stevenson's compassionate efforts to connect with Charlie demonstrate a caring, fatherly concern that Charlie desperately needs. In contrast to the adults who have exploited Charlie and contributed to his suffering, Stevenson stands out as a beacon of hope.
(5)     Enraged by the negligence that allowed Charlie to be raped, Stevenson confronts a jail officer who initially shows indifference. However, when Stevenson threatens to inform the judge, the officer agrees to keep Charlie separated from other inmates for the day. Determined to seek justice, Stevenson demands immediate meetings with the judge and prosecutor, informing them of Charlie's assault. They agree to move Charlie to a safe cell. Stevenson ultimately decides to take on Charlie's case, successfully having him tried as a juvenile and sent to a juvenile detention center. Over the years, Stevenson visits Charlie frequently, witnessing the immense challenges he faces in recovering and forgiving himself.
(6)     Driven by a sense of responsibility for Charlie's safety, Stevenson's anger towards those who failed to protect him fuels his determination to fight for justice. The judge and prosecutor's agreement to Stevenson's requests may indicate their recognition of their mistakes. At a church meeting, Stevenson shares Charlie's story, leading him to meet Mr. and Mrs. Jennings, a couple who lost their grandchild to suicide. Moved by Charlie's plight, they offer their support, even using the money they had saved for their grandson's college education to help Charlie. With Charlie's grandmother deceased and his mother struggling, the Jennings become like family to him. Mrs. Jennings emphasizes the importance of expecting more from each other, fostering hope, and healing from pain. When Charlie is eventually released from prison, his mom and the Jennings are there to support him, fulfilling their promise to see him through college.
(7)     The story of the Jennings' friendship with Charlie exemplifies the significance of finding redemption and hope amidst suffering. Although they were strangers before, the shared experience of loss and Charlie's need for assistance forged a bond based on love and support. While they cannot change what happened to their grandson, helping Charlie overcome his trauma and build a better life may bring healing and redemption to the Jennings as well. Mrs. Jennings reminds Stevenson of the importance of believing in people's potential to do better, even in the face of adversity.
